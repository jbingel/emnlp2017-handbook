Pivot translation is a useful method for translating between languages with little or no parallel data by utilizing parallel data in an intermediate language such as English. A popular approach for pivot translation used in phrase-based or tree-based translation models combines source-pivot and pivot-target translation models into a source-target model, as known as triangulation. However, this combination is based on the constituent words'surface forms and often produces incorrect source-target phrase pairs due to semantic ambiguity in the pivot language, and interlingual differences. This degrades translation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a approach for the triangulation using syntactic subtrees in the pivot language to distinguish pivot language words by their syntactic roles to avoid incorrect phrase combinations. Experimental results on the United Nations Parallel Corpus show the proposed method gains in all tested combinations of language, up to 2.3 BLEU points.
