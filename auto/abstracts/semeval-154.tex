SUDOKU's submissions to SemEval Task 13 treats Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Entity Linking (EL) as a deterministic problem that exploits two key attributes of open-class words as constraints -- their degree of polysemy and their part of speech. This is an extension and further validation of the results achieved by Manion \& Sainudiin (2014). SUDOKU's three submissions are incremental in the use of the two aforementioned constraints. Run1 has no constraints and disambiguates all lemmas in one pass. Run2 disambiguates lemmas at increasing degrees of polysemy, leaving the most polysemous until last. Run3 is identical to Run2, with the additional constraint of disambiguating all named entities and nouns first before other types of open-class words (verbs, adjectives, and adverbs). Over all-domains, for English Run2 and Run3 were placed second and third. For Spanish Run2, Run3, and Run1 were placed first, second, and third respectively. For Italian Run1 was placed first with Run2 and Run3 placed second equal.
