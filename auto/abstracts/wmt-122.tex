We present the results from the second shared task on multimodal machine translation and multilingual image description. Nine teams submitted 19 systems to two tasks. The multimodal translation task, in which the source sentence is supplemented by an image, was extended with a new language (French) and two new test sets. The multilingual image description task was changed such that at test time, only the image is given. Compared to last year, multimodal systems improved, but text-only systems remain competitive.
