This paper describes SYSTRAN's systems submitted to the WMT 2017 shared news translation task for English-German, in both translation directions. Our systems are built using OpenNMT, an open-source neural machine translation system, implementing sequence-to-sequence models with LSTM encoder/decoders and attention. We experimented using monolingual data automatically back-translated. Our resulting models are further hyper-specialised with an adaptation technique that finely tunes models according to the evaluation test sentences.
