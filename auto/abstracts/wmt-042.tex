This submission investigates alternative machine learning models for predicting the HTER score on the sentence level. Instead of directly predicting the HTER score, we suggest a model that jointly predicts the amount of the 4 distinct post-editing operations, which are then used to calculate the HTER score. This also gives the possibility to correct invalid (e.g.{\textasciitilde}negative) predicted values prior to the calculation of the HTER score. Without any feature exploration, a multi-layer perceptron with 4 outputs yields small but significant improvements over the baseline.
