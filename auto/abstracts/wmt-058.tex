This paper describes the University of Edinburgh's submissions to the WMT17 shared news translation and biomedical translation tasks. We participated in 12 translation directions for news, translating between English and Czech, German, Latvian, Russian, Turkish and Chinese. For the biomedical task we submitted systems for English to Czech, German, Polish and Romanian. Our systems are neural machine translation systems trained with Nematus, an attentional encoder-decoder. We follow our setup from last year and build BPE-based models with parallel and back-translated monolingual training data. Novelties this year include the use of deep architectures, layer normalization, and more compact models due to weight tying and  improvements in BPE segmentations. We perform extensive ablative experiments, reporting on the effectivenes of layer normalization, deep architectures, and different ensembling techniques.
