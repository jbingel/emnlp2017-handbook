This paper describes the USAAR-CHRONOS participation in the Diachronic Text Evaluation task of SemEval-2015 to identify the time period of historical text snippets. We adapt a web crawler to retrieve the original source of the text snippets and determine the publication year of the retrieved texts from their URLs. We report a precision score of >90\% in identifying the text epoch on all three granularity levels. Additionally, by crawling and cleaning the website that hosts the source of the text snippets, we present Daikon, a corpus that can be used for future work on epoch identification from a diachronic perspective
