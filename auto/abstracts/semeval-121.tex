This paper reports the description and performance of our system, FBK-HLT, participating in the SemEval 2015, Task \#3 ``Answer Se- lection in Community Question Answering'' for English, for both subtasks. We submit two runs with different classifiers in combining typical features (lexical similarity, string similarity, word n-grams, etc) with machine translation evaluation metrics and with some ad hoc features (e.g user overlapping, spam filtering). We outperform the baseline system and achieve interesting results on the both subtasks.
