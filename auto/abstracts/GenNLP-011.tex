This paper describes a builder entry, named ``strawman'', to the sentence-level sentiment analysis task of the ``Build It, Break It'' shared task of the First Workshop on Building Linguistically Generalizable NLP Systems. The goal of a builder is to provide an automated sentiment analyzer that would serve as a target for breakers whose goal is to find pairs of minimally-differing sentences that break the analyzer.
