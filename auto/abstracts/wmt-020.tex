We describe the University of Maryland machine translation systems submitted to the WMT17 German-English Bandit Learning Task. The task is to adapt a translation system to a new domain, using only bandit feedback: the system receives a German sentence to translate, produces an English sentence, and only gets a scalar score as feedback. Targeting these two challenges (adaptation and bandit learning), we built a standard neural machine translation system and extended it in two ways: (1) robust reinforcement learning techniques to learn effectively from the bandit feedback, and (2) domain adaptation using data selection from a large corpus of parallel data.
