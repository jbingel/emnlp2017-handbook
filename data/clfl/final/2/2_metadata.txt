Abstract#==#In this paper we present a specific application of SPARSAR, a system for poetry
analysis and TextToSpeech “expressive reading”. We will focus on the
graphical
output organized at three macro levels, a Phonetic Relational View where
phonetic and phonological features are highlighted; a Poetic Relational View
that accounts for a poem rhyming and metrical structure; and a Semantic
Relational View that shows semantic and pragmatic relations in the poem. We
will also discuss how colours may be used appropriately to account for the
overall underlying attitude expressed in the poem, whether directed to sadness
or to happiness. This is done following traditional approaches which assume
that the underlying feeling of a poem is strictly related to the sounds
conveyed by the words besides their meaning. This will be shown using part of
Shakespeare’s Sonnets.
