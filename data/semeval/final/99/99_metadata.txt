Abstract#==#This paper describes our participation in
SemEval-2015 Task 12, and the opinion min-
ing system sentiue. The general idea is
that systems must determine the polarity of the
sentiment expressed about a certain aspect of
a target entity. For slot 1, entity and attribute
category detection, our system applies a super-
vised machine learning classifier, for each la-
bel, followed by a selection based on the prob-
ability of the entity/attribute pair, on that do-
main. The target expression detection, for slot
2, is achieved by using a catalog of known
targets for each entity type, complemented
with named entity recognition. In the opin-
ion sentiment slot, we used a 3 class polarity
classifier, having BoW, lemmas, bigrams after
verbs, presence of polarized terms, and punc-
tuation based features. Working in uncon-
strained mode, our results for slot 1 were as-
sessed with precision between 57% and 63%,
and recall varying between 42% and 47%.
In sentiment polarity, sentiue’s result ac-
curacy was approximately 79%, reaching the
best score in 2 of the 3 domains.
