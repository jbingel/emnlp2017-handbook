Abstract#==#We describe two tasks—named entity recognition (Task 1) and template slot
filling (Task 2)—for clinical texts. The tasks leverage annotations from the
ShARe corpus, which consists of clinical notes with annotated mentions
disorders, along with their normalization to a medical terminology and eight
additional attributes. The purpose of these tasks was to identify advances in
clinical named entity recognition and establish the state of the art in
disorder template slot filling. Task 2 consisted of two subtasks: template slot
filling given gold-standard disorder spans (Task 2a) and end-to-end disorder
span identification together with template slot filling (Task 2b). For Task 1
(disorder span detection and normalization), 16 teams participated. The best
system yielded a strict F1-score of 75.7, with a precision of 78.3 and recall
of 73.2. For Task 2a (template slot filling given gold- standard disorder
spans), six teams participated. The best system yielded a combined overall
weighted accuracy for slot filling of 88.6. For Task 2b (disorder recognition
and template slot filling), nine teams participated. The best system yielded a
combined relaxed F (for span detection) and overall weighted accuracy of 80.8.
