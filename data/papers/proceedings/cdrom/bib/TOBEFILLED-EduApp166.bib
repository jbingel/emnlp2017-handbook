  abstract  = {Social media users often make explicit predictions about upcoming events. Such
	statements vary in the degree of certainty the author expresses toward the
	outcome: "Leonardo DiCaprio will win Best Actor" vs. "Leonardo DiCaprio may
	win" or "No way Leonardo wins!". Can popular beliefs on social media predict
	who will win? To answer this question, we build a corpus of tweets annotated
	for veridicality on which we train a log-linear classifier that detects
	positive veridicality with high precision. We then forecast uncertain outcomes
	using the wisdom of crowds, by aggregating users' explicit predictions. Our
	method for forecasting winners is fully automated, relying only on a set of
	contenders as input. It requires no training data of past outcomes and
	outperforms sentiment and tweet volume baselines on a broad range of contest
	prediction tasks. We further demonstrate how our approach can be used to
	measure the reliability of individual accounts' predictions and retrospectively
	identify surprise outcomes.},
