  abstract  = {We present SuperPivot, an analysis method for low-resource languages that occur
	in a superparallel corpus, i.e., in a corpus that contains an order of
	magnitude more languages than parallel corpora currently in use. We show that
	SuperPivot performs well for the crosslingual analysis of the linguistic
	phenomenon of tense. We produce analysis results for more than 1000 languages,
	conducting -- to the best of our knowledge -- the largest crosslingual
	computational study performed to date. We extend existing methodology for
	leveraging parallel corpora for typological analysis by overcoming a limiting
	assumption of earlier work: We only require that a linguistic feature is
	overtly marked in a few of thousands of languages as opposed to requiring that
	it be marked in all languages under investigation.},
