Abstract#==#Much of scientific progress stems from previously published findings, but
searching through the vast sea of scientific publications is difficult. We
often rely on metrics of scholarly authority to find the prominent authors but
these authority indices do not differentiate authority based on research
topics. We present Latent Topical-Authority Indexing (LTAI) for jointly
modeling the topics, citations, and topical authority in a corpus of academic
papers. Compared to previous models, LTAI differs in two main aspects. First,
it explicitly models the generative process of the citations, rather than
treating the citations as given. Second, it models each author's influence on
citations of a paper based on the topics of the cited papers, as well as the
citing papers. We fit LTAI to four academic corpora: CORA, Arxiv Physics, PNAS,
and Citeseer. We compare the performance of LTAI against various baselines,
starting with the latent Dirichlet allocation, to the more advanced models
including author-link topic model and dynamic author citation topic model. The
results show that LTAI achieves improved accuracy over other similar models
when predicting words, citations and authors of publications.
