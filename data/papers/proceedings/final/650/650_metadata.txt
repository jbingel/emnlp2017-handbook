Abstract#==#We introduce a novel sub-character architecture that exploits a unique
compositional structure of the Korean language. Our method decomposes each
character into a small set of primitive phonetic units called jamo letters from
which character- and word-level representations are induced. The jamo letters
divulge syntactic and semantic information that is difficult to access with
conventional character-level units. They greatly alleviate the data sparsity
problem, reducing the observation space to 1.6% of the original while
increasing accuracy in our experiments. We apply our architecture to dependency
parsing and achieve dramatic improvement over strong lexical baselines.
