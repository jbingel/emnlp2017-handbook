Abstract#==#We describe a novel max-margin learning approach to optimize non-linear
performance measures for  distantly-supervised relation extraction models. Our
approach can be generally used to learn latent variable models under
multivariate non-linear performance measures, such as F_β-score. Our approach
interleaves Concave-Convex Procedure (CCCP) for populating  latent variables
with dual decomposition to factorize the original hard problem into smaller
independent sub-problems. The experimental results demonstrate that our
learning algorithm is more effective than the ones commonly used in the
literature for distant supervision of information extraction models. On several
data conditions, we show that our method outperforms the baseline and results
in up to 8.5% improvement in the F_1-score.
