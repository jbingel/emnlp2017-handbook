Abstract#==#Analyzing public opinions towards products, services and social events is an
important but challenging task. An accurate sentiment analyzer should take both
lexicon-level information and corpus-level information into account. It also
needs to exploit the domain-specific knowledge and utilize the common knowledge
shared across domains. In addition, we want the algorithm being able to deal
with missing labels and learning from incomplete sentiment lexicons. This paper
presents a LCCT (Lexicon-based and Corpus-based, Co-Training) model for
semi-supervised sentiment classification. The proposed method combines the idea
of lexicon-based learning and corpus-based learning in a unified co-training
framework. It is capable of incorporating both domain-specific and
domain-independent knowledge. Extensive experiments show that it achieves very
competitive classification accuracy, even with a small portion of labeled data.
Comparing to state-of-the-art sentiment classification methods, the LCCT
approach exhibits significantly better performances on a variety of datasets in
both English and Chinese.
