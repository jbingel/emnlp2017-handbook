We present a general-purpose tagger based on convolutional neural networks
	(CNN), used for both composing word vectors and encoding context information.
	The CNN tagger is robust across different tagging tasks: without task-specific
	tuning of hyper-parameters, it achieves state-of-the-art results in
	part-of-speech tagging, morphological tagging and supertagging. The CNN tagger
	is also robust against the out-of-vocabulary problem; it performs well on
	artificially unnormalized texts.
