Abstract#==#For the task of question answering (QA) over Freebase on the WebQuestions
dataset (Berant et al., 2013), we found that 85% of all questions (in the
training set) can be directly answered via a single binary relation. Thus we
turned this task into slot-filling for <question topic, relation, answer>
tuples: predicting relations to get answers given a question’s topic. We
design efficient data structures to identify question topics organically from
46 million Freebase topic names, without employing any NLP processing tools.
Then we present a lean QA system that runs in real time (in offline batch
testing it answered two thousand questions in 51 seconds on a laptop). The
system also achieved 7.8% better F1 score (harmonic mean of average precision
and recall) than the previous state of the art.
