Abstract#==#Information Extraction (IE) has become an indispensable tool in our quest to
handle the data deluge of the information age. IE can broadly be classified
into Named-entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE). In this
thesis, we view the task of IE as finding patterns in unstructured data, which
can either take the form of features and/or be specified by constraints. In
NER, we study the categorization of complex relational features and outline
methods to learn feature combinations through induction. We demonstrate the
efficacy of induction techniques in learning : i) rules for the identification
of named entities in text – the novelty is the application of induction
techniques to learn in a very expressive declarative rule language ii) a richer
sequence labeling model – enabling optimal learning of discriminative
features. In RE, our investigations are in the paradigm of distant supervision,
which facilitates the creation of large albeit noisy training data. We devise
an inference framework in which constraints can be easily specified in learning
relation extractors. In addition, we reformulate the learning objective in a
max-margin framework. To the best of our knowledge, our formulation is the
first to optimize multi-variate non-linear performance measures such as F-β
for a latent variable structure prediction task.
