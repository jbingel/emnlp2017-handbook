Abstract#==#Despite the growing cultural presence of eSports, no corpus contains this genre
of entertainment. This paper presents how a preliminary corpus was created from
broadcast speech from a professional game of the eSport Counter-Strike: Global
Offensive (CS:GO). The corpus was initially annotated following the Automatic
Contact Extraction (ACE) event subtype definitions for game-changing events:
deaths, injuries, and attacks. Event subtype definitions were modified for
further annotation to detect a wider range of game-changing events otherwise
not defined by ACE. A high degree of inter-annotator agreement for most event
subtypes suggests that modifying event subtype definitions for an eSports
corpus is necessary to detect the breadth of game-changing events.
